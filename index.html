                <h1>Why Thanos Gave Loki The Mind Stone?</h1>
                <p>Manipulation and Deception: Thanos knows that Loki is a master manipulator and a cunning individual. By giving Loki the scepter with the Mind Stone, Thanos manipulates Loki into helping him with his plan to acquire the Space Stone. Thanos is aware of Loki’s ambitions and desires, and he uses these traits to his advantage.</p>

                <p>Plan to Obtain the Space Stone: Thanos’s primary objective at that moment is to obtain the Space Stone, which is currently in the possession of the Tesseract. By giving Loki the scepter and promising him power, Thanos ensures Loki's cooperation in retrieving the Tesseract for him.</p>

                <p>Strategic Move: Thanos likely believes that by presenting himself as an ally or benefactor, he can more easily persuade Loki to act on his behalf. This is a strategic move to ensure that Loki's efforts align with Thanos’s goals.</p>

                <p>Testing Loyalty: Thanos also uses this opportunity to test Loki’s loyalty and see how much he can manipulate him. Thanos knows Loki’s character well enough to exploit his weaknesses and desires for power.</p>
